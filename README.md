# DevEnvCpp
Base Docker container that serves as my dev environment for C++ and possibly some other languages. 

I am thinking of using this as a base to start from to teach some lessons on my YouTube channel at https://www.youtube.com/@ChristopherPisz/
That way everyone will have the same development environment and there will be less guessing about hardware/software someone else has when they ask questions.
